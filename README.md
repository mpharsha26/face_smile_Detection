# Face and Smile Detection
My first Computer Vision application infact !! 
Been playing around with the openCV library which might not have the powerful models but definitely a good source to begin with !

- Application of the <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/the-intuition-behind-facial-detection-the-viola-jones-algorithm-29d9106b6999#:~:text=accessing%20personal%20data.-,The%20Viola%2DJones%20Algorithm,image%20features%20in%20real%2Dtime.">Viola Jones algorithm </a> which involves the detection of haar like features 
- These haar like feature detectors were taken from https://github.com/mpharsha26/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades 

If you'd like to refer to the original research paper by Viola and Jones, then <a href = "http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.10.6807&rep=rep1&type=pdf">here</a> it is for you 
but i would suggest you to go through the above mentioned _towardsdatascience_ link which breaks the complex stuff down to much simpler content <br> 
It actually has all the required understanding to get started with face detection and computer vision stuff !

Happy learning :')
